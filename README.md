# Text Mining: Testing methods
This project is an introduction to the Text Mining's world. I have used various of the algorithm that exists on the scientific literature like TF-IDF, Hashing, LSA, LDA and NLTK python's library.

The objective of my work is to determine if an article belongs to one journal of another. There are 3 journals and 781 articles. Clustering and classifications methods are used for this purpose.

I have also done a report of the project and results obtained.

The project is divided is three parts:

- Preprocessing data: removing punctuation signs, lemmatization, stemming, stopwords, [tf-idf, BoW, hashing], [LSA, LDA]
- Clustering: KMeans, MiniBatchKMeans, Agglomerative, TSEN (visualization)
- Classification: ComplementND, PassiveAggressiveClassifier, SGDClassifier, SVC, RandomForest, Logistic Regression
